# Project template for Python

Check [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/wbwseeker/project_template_python/blob/master/pyproject.toml) to see installed packages and tools.  
This template is complete and can be built (but doesn't do anything).

Build by typing `make`. This will build the project for development.

### Dependencies

* python 3.8
* virtualenv
* make
